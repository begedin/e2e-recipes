# Changelog for v1.4

See the [upgrade guides](https://gist.github.com/chrismccord/bb1f8b136f5a9e4abc0bfc07b832257e) to bring your Phoenix 1.3.x apps up to speed, including instructions on upgrading to Cowboy 2 for HTTP support.

## The Socket <-> Transport contract

We have used the opportunity of writing the new Cowboy 2 adapter to do an overhaul in how `Phoenix.Socket` interacts with transports. The result is a new API that makes it very easy to implement new transports and also allows developers to provide custom socket implementations without ceremony. For example, if you would like to have direct control of the socket and bypass the channel implementation completely, it is now very straight-forward to do so. See the `Phoenix.Socket.Transport` behaviour for more information.

This overhaul means that the `transport/3` macro in `Phoenix.Socket` is deprecated. Instead of defining transports in your socket.ex file:

    transport :websocket, Phoenix.Transport.Websocket,
      key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3

    transport :longpoll, Phoenix.Transport.LongPoll,
      key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3

Configurations must be applied directly in your endpoint file via the `Phoenix.Endpoint.socket/3` macro:

    socket "/socket", MyApp.UserSocket,
      websocket: [key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3],
      longpoll: [key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3]

Note the websocket/longpoll configuration given to socket/3 will only apply after you remove all `transport/3` calls from your socket definition. If you have explicitly upgraded to Cowboy 2, any transport defined with the `transport/3` macro will be ignored.

The old APIs for building transports are also deprecated. The good news is: adapting an existing transport to the new API is a less error prone process where you should mostly remove code.
